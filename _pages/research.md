I am fascinated by how creatures shape each other's traits, alter each other's environments, and ultimately, affect each other's evolutionary histories. In particular, I explore these processes in communities of plants their antagonistic and mutualistic forager species.

# Theory of eco-evolutionary resource dynamics among plants, pollinators, and herbivores

Wouldn't it be fantastic to precisely manipulate aspects of the environment and measure the joint outcomes for population dynamics and trait evolution in a whole community? This is where theory becomes a useful tool for large-scale natural experimentation. By precisely manipulating parameters defining species behavior, physiology, or ecology, we can explore integrated ecological and evolutionary processes in whole communities, in a matter of minutes.

## Recent work in this area:

[McPeek, S. J., Bronstein, J. L., & McPeek, M. A. (2022). Eco-Evolutionary Feedbacks Among Pollinators, Herbivores, And Their Plant Resources. Evolution in press. doi: 10.1111/evo.14492](https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14492)

Our newest work in <i>Evolution</i> explores feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary dynamics among a plant species and its two forager species: an antagonistic herbivore and a mutualistic pollinator. We examine how a plant's pollinator attraction traits (nectar) and herbivore defense traits (toxin) evolve in response to both forager species, and how evolutionary shifts in these traits affect the resulting population dynamics of plants and their consumers. We find that increasing herbivore foraging causes the plant to evolve an increase in nectar production, and vice versa increasing pollinator foraging causes the plant to evolve and increase in toxin production. Both these responses are driven by the effects of these resource traits on consumer, and consequently, plant abundance in the community.

Can a pollinator foster the coexistence of two competing plant species? Our paper in <i> Oikos </i> suggests it may be harder than it seems. We build an ecological model of two plant species that compete for a limiting soil nutrient, produce nectar, and interact with a single shared pollinator species. Overall, we find that pollinators intensify resource competition among the plant species, making it more challenging for both to persist. Each plant's nectar supply plays a key role in fostering their interaction with both pollinator species.

The evolution of mutualism has been a challenging subject for evolutionary theory. How could one species evolve via natural selection for the benefit of another? In our paper in <i> American Naturalist</i>, we develop a theory of eco-evolutionary dynamics in a nectar-producing plant's interaction with a nectar-foraging pollinator. Our work demonstrates how the positive effects of nectar on pollinator foraging rates and pollinator population growth select for the evolution of increased nectar provisioning under a wide range of ecological scenarios.

# Natural selection on nectar and toxin traits in <i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i>

My empirical research focuses on the wonderfully weird and toxic wildflower, <i>Amianthium muscaetoxicum</i> and its community of pollinating beetle foragers.
